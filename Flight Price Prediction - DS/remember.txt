# Note on Model File Generation

When the training script is executed (e.g., train_model.py or notebook), the model is trained on the cleaned flight data.

‚úÖ After successful training, the following serialized model file is automatically generated and saved:

    ‚û§ model/flight_price_model.pkl , label_encoders.pkl
-- Download the flight_booking.csv from kaggle.com

üì¶ This file contains the trained Random Forest Regressor used for prediction.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This file is large (~500MB) and is not pushed to the GitHub repository.
