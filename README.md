# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Model

A Machine Learning project that predicts flight ticket prices based on various parameters such as airline, source, destination, departure/arrival times, etc. The model is trained using over 300,000 flight records and deployed as an interactive web application.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data preprocessing
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
- **Random Forest Regressor** (R² = 0.985)
- **Streamlit** for building the web application

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts flight prices based on user input
- Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and selects relevant features
- Compares performance of multiple models
- Visualizes insights from data using plots and graphs
